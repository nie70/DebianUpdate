Script to update Debian 11 to 12

Instructions:

Backup Important Data: Before proceeding, ensure you have backups of important data.
Run the Script:
Copy the script into a file, e.g., update_to_debian12.sh.
Make the script executable: chmod +x update_to_debian12.sh.
Run the script with sudo privileges: sudo ./update_to_debian12.sh.
Review Changes:
The script updates the package lists (apt update), upgrades installed packages (apt upgrade), and performs a distribution upgrade (apt dist-upgrade).
It modifies /etc/apt/sources.list to point to Debian 12 ("bookworm") repositories.
Reboot: After the script completes, reboot your system (sudo reboot) to ensure all changes take effect.
Post-Upgrade Checks:
After rebooting, log in and verify that the system is running Debian 12.
Check for any errors or issues in system logs.
Test critical applications to ensure compatibility with Debian 12.
Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues during or after the upgrade, refer to Debian's release notes and community forums for troubleshooting steps.
Important Notes:

Backups: Always back up important data before performing system upgrades.
Review Release Notes: Check Debian 12 release notes for specific upgrade considerations.
Third-Party Repositories: If you use third-party repositories, ensure they are compatible with Debian 12 before upgrading.
This script provides a basic outline for upgrading Debian 11 to Debian 12. However, please exercise caution and consider consulting Debian's official documentation and community resources for additional guidance tailored to your specific environment.
